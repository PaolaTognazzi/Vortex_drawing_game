# Vortex_drawing_game
This is a website for the Vortex game. The code allows to draw colourful compositions
of spiralling elements. In the code are hidden key press features. Users that guess all the features coded in the game wins. 
While it's a dynamic pattern recognition game,  it also aims at fostering artistic exploration
and creativity. Play with it and send us the most interesting paintings you draw.
